# Ocvo - OpenCV Objects #
[OpenCV](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/) is a great library for Computer
Vision, but the Python bindings are just 1300+ functions, constants, and
structs thrown together. This package tries to wrap the library in a more
structured way.
## Installation ##
run `python setup.py install` and enjoy the pre-alpha
not-even-a-real-release-yet.
## Use ##
`import ocvo.{submodule}` 
The current submodules are:

* `objects` is the base. For now, it provides object wrappers for Images and
  Captures.
* `shapes` gives you objects/shapes that can be drawn on images. 
* `labeled` will have similar objects, but will include ports for text input.

## Known Issues ##
* No documentation
* Few features
